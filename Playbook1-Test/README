# Ansible README

This is a really simple playbook that pings 3 nodes that are specified in the host/inventory file. In  this example we will use 3 virtual machine with 4th being the controler where the Ansible service will be install. 

* First create a directory and move into it. 
    ``` mkdir ansible_something && cd ansible_something && pwd ``` 
    If the the command is ran successfully, then you should see that your current working  status is in the newly created directory. 

* Next create a file and paste the host name and the ip address, for ansible playbook to pickup when it runs. 
    ```vi hosts```
    
Then you will want to correct the ip address and the hostnames corresponding to your setup. Please see the host-list for sample. 

```
[test_nodes]
192.168.1.137 ansible_user=ansible-2
192.168.1.135 ansible_user=ansible0
192.168.1.136 ansible_user=ansible-1
```

* In our example, we are  telling in the playbook to run a ping on 3 nodes.
