  name:  Install apache
  hosts: centosServer4
  become: true


# This is the simplest way to write a playbook because you can run one command after another just like a script
  # tasks:
  #   - name:  Install Apache
  #     command: yum install --quiet -y httpd httpd-devel
  #   - name:  Copy Configuration files
  #     command: >
  #       cp httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  #   - command: >
  #       cp httpd-vhosts /etc/httpd/conf/httpd-vhosts.conf
  #   - name:  Start Apache and configure it to run at boot. 
  #     command: service httpd start
  #   - commaand: httpd on


    # OR 
# This is another way of running list of task using the shell module
  # tasks:
  #   - name: Install and configure apache 
  #     shell: | 
  #       yum install --quiet -y httpd httpd-devel
  #       cp httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  #       cp httpd-vhosts /etc/httpd/conf/httpd-vhosts.conf
  #       service httpd start



  # OR 
# This is the more of ansible style play.
